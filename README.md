# HodHod
A Persian chat Android application implemented by HiveMQ public broker using **MQTT protocol**. _HodHod_ is a Persian word that means Hoopoe.

## Features
* Enter a room just with its room key and start chatting with people!
* See locations of room members!
* Rooms you have entered and your chats will be persistent!
* Uninstall the application, and your data will be removed forever; no data will be stored!

## Architecture and Technologies
We use [**HiveMQ public MQTT broker**](https://www.mqtt-dashboard.com/) as the server in this project.

We benefited from several Android concepts and libraries, including:
* Coroutines
* Room
* Hilt
* Google Map API
* MQTT Protocol

We tried to use Android best practices in code and UI design to reach the best possible performance in the application.
