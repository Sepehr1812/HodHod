A Persian chat Android application implemented by HiveMQ public broker.

## Features
* Enter a room just with its room key and start chatting with people!
* See locations of room members!
* Rooms you have entered and your chats will be persistante!
* Uninstall the application and your data will be removed for ever; no data will be stored!

## Technologies
In this project, we use HiveMQ public broker as server.<br>
Also, we use Room ORM for managing the database and Hilt as Dependency Injector.<br>
We tried to use Android best practices in code and UI design to reach the best possible performance in the application.
